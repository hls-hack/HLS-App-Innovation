| Category | Title | Level | Description | Last Validated | Validated By |
|-----|-----|-|-|-|-|
| OpenHack | [OpenHack-FHIR](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenHack-FHIR) | L300 | This repository hosts the general guidance and reference architecture(s) for delivering an OpenHack focusing on Azure API for FHIR. |
| Hands-On Lab | [Azure API Management Hands-On Lab](https://azure.github.io/apim-lab/) | L300 | This hands-on-lab will guide you through the different concepts around Azure API Management, from the creation to the DevOps, including good practices in terms of versioning, security and so on. It is designed to bring customers and partners to a 200-level understanding of Azure Api Management. This is meant to be a hands on lab experience, all instructions are provided, but a basic level of understanding of apis is expected(http operations, networking basics, openapi, rest, soap, oauth2 and other concepts). | 12/14/202 | Rob McKenna |
| Hands-On Lab | [AKS Secury Baseline](https://github.com/mspnp/aks-secure-baseline) | L300 | This reference implementation demonstrates the recommended starting (baseline) infrastructure architecture for a general purpose AKS cluster. This implementation and document is meant to guide an interdisciplinary team or multiple distinct teams like networking, security and development through the process of getting this secure baseline infrastructure deployed and understanding the components of it. | | |
| Workshop | [Microsoft Cloud Workshops - Cloud Native Applications](https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Cloud-native-applications) | L200 | In this workshop, you will build a proof of concept (POC) that will transform an existing on-premises application to a container-based application. This POC will deliver a multi-teant web app hosting solution leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Docker containers on Linux nodes, and a migration from MongoDB to CosmosDB.<br/>At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to improve the reliability of and increase the release cadence of your container-based applications through time-tested DevOps practices. | | |
